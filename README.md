# DOE_Project
I wanted to maximise my productivity while working at Gap Inc. as a Merchandise Handler. There were certain factors that could increase or decrease my performance but I had no idea about it. I tried to replicate the environment in external world and found out some interesting observations. 

This was also one of the projects which piqued my interest in Statistics .
